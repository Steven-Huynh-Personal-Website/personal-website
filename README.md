### Home Page
The landing page is your first impression. You can include a photo, your mission statement, and something which defines you. In our example, we have included a quote.

### About Page
An about page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, and things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.

### Ô∏è Portfolio Page
The portfolio page is the meat and potatoes of your personal site, here you want to include the projects you have worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web.

Note: You can use Lorem Ipsum for placeholder content, but it would be great if you included actual content.
